Welcome to RedditRO! Have fun! 

Next update's going to be 10:00 01 SEP. It's going to be longer than our previous updates, we're imposing some new data integrity features that should add a nice layer of security to your data, and let us pick back up much quicker if anything should happen.

This update may take us up to 30-60 Minutes to fully complete.

We'll also be updating the following:
-Fix Start Gladiator's Demon skill to properly activate at Job 50.
-Fix Sorcerer's Elemental Spirits to properly drain SP (Not at 95 times the rate)
-Reduce Pintados Festival Requirements
-Adding Guild Dungeon Warp Scrolls to previously unaccessible dungeons

As always, I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause, and appreciate your patience!
